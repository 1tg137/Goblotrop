#This README is just in an very early alpha
#This is not self-runner and needs an understanding of the underlying system
#a Master-Student in EE or CS should have the understanding to safely operate the system

vids:
	- two video files extracted from the measurements
	- _f = front, _s = side
	 
extract:
	- incorporates the tools used to extract the BoundingBoxes of the house,wheel and mouse from the videos
	- at the current state, the system used a yolov4 network via darknet (https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)
	- two example scripts show the usage of:
			- ./detect front ../vid/feivel_f.mp4		// reads the video file, detects the BB and returns a json file to the result_f folder 
		  - ./detect side ../vid/feivel_s.mp4
 
evaluate:
	- these python scripts are used to evaluate the json files created
	- ./python3 main.py // reads the json files in ../extract/result_f _s and puts out txt files in outdir/ with the corresponding time in s
