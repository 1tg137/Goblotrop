#This README is just in a very early alpha
#This is not self-runner and needs an understanding of the underlying system
#a Master-Student in EE or CS should have the understanding to safely operate the system

These scripts are used to start, stop and test the cameras.
This will run on the storage server (gob-store) of the system.

Prerequisitions:
- four cages, each setup as required in the README in the recordings-section
- Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS / Linuxoid System
- alot of storage
- SMB share setup for access the storage
- gigabit connection to the cages


usage:

- typically, the system is tested before the videos are startet
    -> ./trigger_images.sh will trigger all cameras to take a testshot, which are saved onto the SMB-share 
- the videos can be started via ./cam_start_all.sh
- to finish the recording, the script ./killcam.sh is used
- a good practice was to use a cronjob to start and stop the videos to the wanted times
  -> for us, it was best to start at starttime and stop at the switch between day/nighttime, then start again immediately
     and stop at switching-time again, ... .
  -> this leads to a clear separation between dark/bright video files, which is much easier for the neural network to detect
